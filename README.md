## Description
This project tries to provide an efficient way of solving the popular game named Wordle. The "guess" algorithm
is quite generic and could be implemented for many "guess" games (Mastermind, Hangman, Guess who?, ...). The current
implementation uses an algorithm based on the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA)
from 3Blue1Brown. It finds "SOARE" as the best first guess for Wordle game. In average, it takes less than 3.5 guesses
to find the solution.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine
for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
* Java 16
* Maven 3.6.1
* Git 2.17.1

### Installing
* Clone the repository from GitHub:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Achaaab/wordle-solver.git
```
* Build the project with Maven:
```shell
cd wordle-solver
mvn package
```

### Running
```shell
java -jar target/wordle-solver-x.y.z.jar
```

### Example
```
========================================================================================================================
SOARE found in 1277ms
score? 01110
27 candidates left
razor, arrow, groan, cargo, arbor, manor, major, croak, organ, baron, armor, radio, rayon, labor, valor, ratio, ...
========================================================================================================================
MARON found in 63ms
score? 11110
1 candidate left
aroma
========================================================================================================================
AROMA found in 46ms
score? 22222
```

## Improvements
* Try to improve Wordle scoring time with memoization without using too much memory.
* Computes expected information with depth > 1. It seems that "SOARE" is only the 14th best guess with a depth of 2.

## Contributing
I will gladly consider pull requests until Spring 2022. After this date, I could have moved on something else.
