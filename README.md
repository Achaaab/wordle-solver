## Description
This project tries to provide an efficient way of solving the popular game named Wordle.
The "guess" algorithm is quite generic and could be implemented for many "guess" games (Mastermind, Hangman, Guess who?, ...).
The current implementation uses an algorithm based on the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA) from 3Blue1Brown.
It finds "SOARE" as a best first guess for Wordle game. In average it takes less than 3.5 guesses to find the solution.
