 * A very simple guess game for the sake of validation, where the goal is to find a number with consecutive guesses.
 * Scoring:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>{@link #LESSER}: the solution is lesser than the guess</li>
 *    <li>{@link #EQUAL}: the solution is equal to the guess</li>
 *    <li>{@link #GREATER}: the solution is greater than the guess</li>
 * </ul>
