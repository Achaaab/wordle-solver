/**
 * Wordle is a guess game where the goal is to find a 5-letter word with consecutive guesses which are also
 * 5-letter words.
 *
 * In the real game, scoring is a sequence of colors: 1 color per letter, from left to right.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>green: this letter is in the word, at this position</li>
 *     <li>yellow: this letter is in the word but misplaced</li>
 *     <li>gray: this letter is not in the word</li>
 * </ul>
 * In this implementation, for the sake of performance, we represent those sequences of colors with a base-3 number:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@code [gray, gray, gray, gray, gray]} is represented by 00000<sub>3</sub> = 0<sub>10</sub></li>
 *     <li>{@code [gray, gray, gray, gray, yellow]} is represented by 00001<sub>3</sub> = 1<sub>10</sub></li>
 *     <li>{@code [gray, gray, gray, gray, green]} is represented by 00002<sub>3</sub> = 2<sub>10</sub></li>
 *     <li>{@code [gray, gray, gray, yellow, gray]} is represented by 00010<sub>3</sub> = 3<sub>10</sub></li>
 *     <li>{@code [gray, gray, gray, yellow, green]} is represented by 00012<sub>3</sub> = 5<sub>10</sub></li>
 *     <li>{@code [green, gray, gray, green, yellow]} is represented by 20021<sub>3</sub> = 170<sub>10</sub></li>
 *     <li>{@code [green, green, green, green, green]} is represented by 22222<sub>3</sub> = 242<sub>10</sub></li>
 *     <li>...</li>
 * </ul>
